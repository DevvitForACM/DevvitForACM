# Client Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the client-side application, a React-based game platform built with Phaser.js.

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation
- **[Architecture](./architecture.md)**: Overall system architecture and design patterns
- **[Entity System](./entity-system.md)**: Game entity management and collision system
- **[Level System](./level-system.md)**: Level management, editing, and loading
- **[Phaser Integration](./phaser-integration.md)**: React-Phaser bridge and game engine

## Quick Start

### Key Concepts
1. **React-Phaser Bridge**: Seamless integration between React and Phaser.js
2. **Entity System**: Inheritance-based game object management
3. **Level Editor**: Visual grid-based level creation
4. **Collision System**: AABB collision detection with event handling

### Getting Started
1. Read the [Architecture](./architecture.md) documentation for system overview
2. Review the [Entity System](./entity-system.md) for game object management
3. Check the [Level System](./level-system.md) for level creation and loading
4. Understand the [Phaser Integration](./phaser-integration.md) for game engine details

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **Components**: React components in `/components`
- **Game Logic**: Phaser scenes and entities in `/game`
- **Configuration**: Game settings in `/config` and `/constants`
- **Pages**: Application routes in `/pages`

### Best Practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the established naming conventions
- Maintain clean separation between React and Phaser code
- Document complex game logic and systems

### Performance Considerations
- Use entity culling for large worlds
- Implement chunk-based level streaming
- Monitor memory usage and cleanup
- Optimize asset loading and caching

## System Architecture

### React Layer
- **Components**: UI and game container components
- **Hooks**: Game state management and lifecycle
- **Pages**: Application routing and navigation
- **Global**: Shared styles and type definitions

### Phaser Layer
- **Scenes**: Game states and levels
- **Entities**: Game objects and collision system
- **Controls**: Input handling and camera management
- **Level**: Level data and JSON conversion

### Integration Layer
- **PhaserContainer**: React-Phaser bridge component
- **Game Configuration**: Dual physics engine support
- **Asset Management**: Dynamic loading and caching
- **State Synchronization**: React-Phaser communication

## Future Development

### Planned Features
- Multiplayer support
- Advanced physics simulation
- Audio system integration
- Performance monitoring tools

### Extensibility
- Modular entity system
- Plugin architecture
- Custom scene support
- Advanced level features
