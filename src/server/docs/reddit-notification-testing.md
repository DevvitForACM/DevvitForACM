# Reddit Notification Testing Guide

## Overview

The admin system now sends Reddit Direct Messages instead of email notifications when users are deleted.

## How It Works

1. **Devvit Context**: When running in Devvit, the Reddit client is available and can send actual DMs
2. **Standalone Mode**: When running locally, notifications are logged to console (for testing)

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Local Testing (Standalone Mode)

When you delete a user locally, you'll see console output like:
```
üì® Reddit DM would be sent to u/testuser:
Subject: Account Deletion Notification
Message: Hello,

We're writing to inform you that your account has been removed from our system.

**Reason for deletion:** Violation of community guidelines

If you believe this action was taken in error or if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to our moderation team.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
The Moderation Team
‚ö†Ô∏è Reddit DM API method not found - message logged instead
```

### 2. Devvit Context Testing

When deployed to Devvit, the system will attempt to send actual Reddit DMs using the available Reddit API.

## Updated API Testing

The DELETE user endpoint now triggers Reddit notifications instead of email:

**Test Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/admin/users/:username`

**Expected Behavior**:
- User is deleted from database
- User data is archived in Firestore  
- Reddit DM is sent to the user (or logged in standalone mode)
- Success response is returned

**Console Output Examples**:

**Success (Devvit)**:
```
‚úÖ Reddit DM sent to u/testuser about account deletion
‚úÖ User testuser deleted and archived successfully
```

**Success (Standalone)**:
```
üì® Reddit DM would be sent to u/testuser:
‚ö†Ô∏è Reddit notification not sent - service not available (standalone mode)
‚úÖ User testuser deleted and archived successfully
```

## Benefits of Reddit Notifications

1. **Native Platform**: Users get notified on the platform they're already using
2. **No Email Required**: Works even if users don't have email addresses
3. **Direct Communication**: Private messages are more personal than emails
4. **Platform Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with Reddit's messaging system

## Implementation Notes

- Notifications are non-blocking (user deletion succeeds even if notification fails)
- Graceful fallback for different environments
- Proper error handling and logging
- Message formatting optimized for Reddit's interface
